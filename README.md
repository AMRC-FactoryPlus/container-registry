# Factory+ Container Registry Stack
The Container Registry Stack consists of an empty instance of the Docker image registry, enabling container images to be pushed and hosted locally within the Factory+ architecture. This has the benefit of faster download times to edge nodes and removes the dependency for Cell Gateways to be connected to the internet, improving security.
